# 🎄 Advent of Rust 2024

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) implemented in Rust. I'm using this challenge to improve my Rust skills and learn more about the language while solving interesting problems.

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn and practice Rust programming concepts
- Understand Rust's ownership system better
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Document my learning journey
- Share knowledge with others

## 📚 Structure

Each day's solution is in its own directory (`day01`, `day02`, etc.) and contains:
- A README explaining the problem and my approach
- The solution code
- Any input files
- Tests where applicable

## 🚀 Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cd dayXX
cargo run
```

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

## 📝 Progress

- [x] Day 1: Message Ownership Challenge
- [ ] Day 2: (Coming Soon)

## 🤔 Learnings

I'll be documenting key learnings and insights in each day's README. This will serve as a learning journal and reference for others.

## 🤝 Contributing

While these are my personal solutions, I'm open to discussions and suggestions! Feel free to open an issue if you want to discuss a particular solution or approach.
